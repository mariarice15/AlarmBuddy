The code in module2.ino was flashed to the TTGO T-display. This code gathers the button and potentiometer data from the TTGO.

Connect the TTGO with the flashed code to a computer via a USB-C cord. On the laptop, display the webpage and click "Connect" to connect to the TTGO through the relevant USB port. Then, use the potentiometer and button to set the alarm. Specific instrutions may be found here: https://www.mariarice.com/projects/smart-alarm-clock
